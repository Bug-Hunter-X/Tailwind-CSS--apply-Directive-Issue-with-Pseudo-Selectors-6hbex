To resolve this issue, avoid using the `@apply` directive with classes that contain pseudo-selectors. Instead, apply the styles directly in the component's stylesheet or use the standard Tailwind utility classes.  For example, modify the code like this:

```css
.btn {
  bg-blue-500 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded;
}

.btn:hover {
  @apply bg-blue-700;
}
```

This approach ensures that the `bg-blue-500` is only applied in the default state and `bg-blue-700` only when hovering.
